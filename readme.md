# Pi Estimation with Monte Carlo

This project uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of π by generating random points within a square and counting how many fall within the inscribed circle.

---

## Concept

\[
\pi \approx 4 \times \frac{\text{points inside the circle}}{\text{total points}}
\]

- Square: side 2, centered at the origin  
- Circle: radius 1  
- `x² + y² <= 1` defines whether the point is inside the circle  

---

The script will:

Generate random points

Calculate the π estimation

Display a plot with:

Points inside the circle (blue)

Points outside the circle (red)

Reference circle and square

## Execution

Run the script:

```bash
python pi_estimation.py
